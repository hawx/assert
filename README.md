This is a clone/modification of

should use instead of this. I am going to be making changes to this at some
point, so do not use/rely on it being in a good state!

# assert

The `assert` package provides some helpful methods that allow you to write better test code in Go.

  * Prints friendly, easy to read failure descriptions
  * Allows for very readable code
  * Optionally annotate each assertion with a message

See it in action:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "hawx.me/code/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(t, 123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(t, 123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(t, object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(t, object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal(t, "Something", object.Value)

  }

}
```

  * Every assert func takes the `testing.T` object as the first argument.  This is how it writes the errors out through the normal `go test` capabilities.
  * Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.

if you assert many times, use the below:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "hawx.me/code/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
  assert := assert.New(t)

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal("Something", object.Value)
  }
}
```
